## THIS IS THE DOOM COSINE CHAOS!

DOOM Cosine Chaos aims to make the original vanilla DOOM become non-euclidean by modifying the `finesine` and `finetangent` tables in `src/tables.c`! I ACTUALLY made it and i'm happy, like very happy! Here are some stuff to know tho!

### Reporting Bugs
This port is a fork of another DOOM port called [chocolate-DOOM](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom) which is licenced under GNU GPL-v2.0. And Chocolate-DOOM is a DOOM port that tries to recreate everything about the original vanilla DOOM that ran on DOS, even the bugs are recreated! But DOOM Cosine Chaos is a fork of it that makes DOOM ******_(ALMOST)_****** non-euclidean! Yeah, there will be many more bugs like enemies no-clipping or some stuff being closer than it should or more away than it is supposed to be or more, but that is just non-euclidean stuff, right?


### Feature requests

DOOM Cosine Chaos is always open to new feature requests; however, please
be aware that the project is designed around a deliberately limited (and
absolutely unmodified, because i did not have enough time to do it)
[philosophy](../PHILOSOPHY.md), and many features common in other source
ports will not be accepted. Here are a few common requests which are
often rejected:

* "High resolution" rendering (greater than 320x200 display).

* An option to disable Vanilla limits, such as the visplane rendering
  limit.

* Ability to play "No Rest For The Living", the expansion pack which
  comes with the XBLA / BFG Edition of Doom.

* Making this DOOM port thing non-euclidean (the non-euclidean stuff is a feature! Not a bug!)

(I have no idea if i should modify the PHILOSOPHY file of Chocolate-DOOM).
