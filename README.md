# DOOM Cosine Chaos

DOOM Cosine Chaos is a fork of [Chocolate-DOOM](chocolate-doom.org), and it is not a normal one, but a (ALMOST) non-euclidean one! This DOOM port simply has a thing in it... in `src/tables.c`, the `finesine` and `finetangent` are modified so it is non-euclidean! There is also a python script there called `corrupt_sine.py` which is designed to re-corrupt the `finesine` and `finetangent` tables!
This is a Chocolate-DOOM port by the way (i repeated the same thing btw).

DOOM Cosine Chaos has:

 * To always be 100% Free and Open Source software.
 * Support to some OSes (Linux, Windows, whatever)
 * CORRUPTED SINE TABLES
 * Compatibility with the DOS demo, configuration and savegame files.
 * A accurate recreation of the original DOS game, but with non-euclidean stuff!

You may find many similarities to Chocolate-DOOM tho!
